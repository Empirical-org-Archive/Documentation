      <h1>Guide - Naming Google Drive Files</h1>

<p><strong>Every file in Google Drive should have a label that proceeds it. This label describes what type of work this piece is.</strong></p>

<p><em>For example, "Guide - Naming Google Drive Labels" describes how this is a guide for naming things.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Guide</strong> - A guide contains documentation for how something should be built. </p>

<p><strong>Resource</strong> - The resource folder contains a piece of content, such as a lesson or art assets. </p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong> - A timeline file contains a list of dates for when various tasks were completed.</p>

<p><strong>Community</strong> - A communities file contains a list of communities related to that field. </p>

<p><strong>Communications</strong> - A communications file contains our standard responses to common questions. </p>

<p><strong>Debate</strong> - A public debates file outlines two choices we face with a particularly important issue. We create a public document so that we can receive input from a variety of perspectives. </p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong> - A notes file contains a rough draft of an idea. Over time these notes files will be processed into design documents, resources, publications,etc. </p>

<p><strong>Index</strong> - An index folder aggregates documents from across other folders. To create a shortcut, open the “move to button” and carefully open up the index file, and hold on control to move it two locations. </p>

<p><strong>Advice</strong> - An advice file contains a piece of advice from an external source. </p>

<p><strong>Publications</strong> - A publications file is a complete, polished document that we can share with others.</p>

<p><strong>Projects</strong> - A projects folder is a folder that contains a particular project we are working on. </p>

<p><strong>Mentor</strong> - A mentor file is a piece of advice explicitly given to us from one of our mentors and advisors. We are saving all of these files, and we will feature our mentor’s advice in a blog. </p>

<p><strong>Outreach</strong> - An outreach file contains a pitch we have presented for a various project. The outreach file contains all of the work that went into presenting that pitch. </p>

<h2>Project Stages</h2>

<p><strong>Certain Projects will have a time sensitive nature to them. We will append a label to indiciate the stage for certain projects.</strong></p>

<p><em>For example, *</em>"(Seed) Project - Interactive Tutorial"** means that this project is still in the germination stage.*</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>(Seed) File:</strong> These are raw files that have not yet been processed. As a project gets started there will be a bunch of ideas, notes, starting files, diagrams. These all go in raw files. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>(Current) Files:</strong> As these pieces get put together into pieces of work, these pieces are listed under current files. The current files are currently under construction, and they are still being reviewed. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>(Built)</strong> Files: Once a file has been built and is ready to review, it is moved to the built files folder. </p></li>
</ol>
