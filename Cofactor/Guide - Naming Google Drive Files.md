# Guide - Naming Google Drive Files

**Every file in Google Drive should have a label that proceeds it. This label describes what type of work this piece is.**

*For example, "Guide - Naming Google Drive Labels" describes how this is a guide for naming things.* 


**Guide** - A guide contains documentation for how something should be built. 

**Resource** - The resource folder contains a piece of content, such as a lesson or art assets. 

**Timeline** - A timeline file contains a list of dates for when various tasks were completed.

**Community** - A communities file contains a list of communities related to that field. 

**Communications** - A communications file contains our standard responses to common questions. 

**Debate** - A public debates file outlines two choices we face with a particularly important issue. We create a public document so that we can receive input from a variety of perspectives. 

**Notes** - A notes file contains a rough draft of an idea. Over time these notes files will be processed into design documents, resources, publications,etc. 

**Index** - An index folder aggregates documents from across other folders. To create a shortcut, open the “move to button” and carefully open up the index file, and hold on control to move it two locations. 

**Advice** - An advice file contains a piece of advice from an external source. 

**Publications** - A publications file is a complete, polished document that we can share with others.

**Projects** - A projects folder is a folder that contains a particular project we are working on. 

**Mentor** - A mentor file is a piece of advice explicitly given to us from one of our mentors and advisors. We are saving all of these files, and we will feature our mentor’s advice in a blog. 

**Outreach** - An outreach file contains a pitch we have presented for a various project. The outreach file contains all of the work that went into presenting that pitch. 



## Project Stages
**Certain Projects will have a time sensitive nature to them. We will append a label to indiciate the stage for certain projects.**

*For example, **"(Seed) Project - Interactive Tutorial"** means that this project is still in the germination stage.*



1. **(Seed) File:** These are raw files that have not yet been processed. As a project gets started there will be a bunch of ideas, notes, starting files, diagrams. These all go in raw files. 

2. **(Current) Files:** As these pieces get put together into pieces of work, these pieces are listed under current files. The current files are currently under construction, and they are still being reviewed. 

3. **(Built)** Files: Once a file has been built and is ready to review, it is moved to the built files folder.
