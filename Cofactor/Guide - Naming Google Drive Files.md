# Guide - Naming Google Drive Files

**Every file in Google Drive should have a label that proceeds it. This label describes what type of work this piece is.**

*For example, "Guide - Naming Google Drive Labels" describes how this is a guide for naming things.* 


**Guide** - A guide contains documentation for how something should be built. 

**Resource** - The resource folder contains a piece of content, such as a lesson or art assets. 

**Timeline** - A timeline file contains a list of dates for when various tasks were completed.

**Community** - A communities file contains a list of communities related to that field. 

**Communications** - A communications file contains our standard responses to common questions. 

**Debate** - A public debates file outlines two choices we face with a particularly important issue. We create a public document so that we can receive input from a variety of perspectives. 

**Notes** - A notes file contains a rough draft of an idea. Over time these notes files will be processed into design documents. 

**Index** - An index folder aggregates documents from across other folders. To create a shortcut, open the “move to button” and carefully open up the index file, and hold on control to move it two locations. 

**Advice** - An advice file contains a piece of advice from an external source. 

**Publications** - A publications file is a complete, polished document that we can share with others.

**Projects** - A projects folder is a folder that contains a particular project we are working on. 

**Mentor** - A mentor file is a piece of advice explicitly given to us from one of our mentors and advisors. We are saving all of these files, and we will feature our mentor’s advice in a blog. 

**Outreach** - An outreach file contains a pitch we have presented for a various project. The outreach file contains all of the work that went into presenting that pitch. 









Notes Folder (i.e. Notes - Activity Design). A notes folder contains rough draft ideas, written by members of our team, detailing how to build things. Over time notes will be processed into guides or blogs, and the goal is to create knowledge which can be shared with others. 

Each team member should have their own notes, and this starts out as a folder where random documents are dumped. Over time these notes should be parsed together and presented through a formal structure, i.e. notes should be tagged together, assembled into maps, and commented on. 

Advice Folder  (i.e. Advice - Presentations). This folder contains blog entries, presentations, and other materials from people outside of our organization discussing how to build things. The purpose of this folder is to gather together resources that we share with one another. Overtime, these resources should be tagged and assembled into knowledge maps.

Discussing Advice Materials: Once nice feature would be to enable people to comment on documents. We could do this by simply copying and pasting all articles into google drive, and using google drive as the basis for sharing information. This is instead of say importing all of our documents into evernote, and having people comment through evernote, or a program like diigo. 

Index Folder  (i.e. Index - Presentations). The index folder is a folder that is linked to another folder.  This is to ensure that files that need to be in two places have the same source. 

To index a folder, open the “Move to folder” button. Then, while holding down on the command key, expand the “master index folder” and click on the “index - guides” folder. This will cross link the folder to the guide. 


Project Stages
Within an individual project, files will be split up into four sub-folders: 

1. Seed File: These are raw files that have not yet been processed. As a project gets started there will be a bunch of ideas, notes, starting files, diagrams. These all go in raw files. 

2. Current Files: As these pieces get put together into pieces of work, these pieces are listed under current files. The current files are currently under construction, and they are still being reviewed. 

3. Built Files: Once a file has been built and is ready to review, it is moved to the built files folder. 

4. Archived Files: As we build new things, old thing will be retired. Old files, that are no longer needed, but which should be kept around as a record of the past, should be moved to archive. 

e1.  Extra File:  The "e" label is used throughout the system to specify anything that is outside of the logic of the system. For example, within this context, e1. could be new ideas that arise out of the project. They are in e1., and then they should be moved to an ideas folder. 


Supplemental Folder Information

1) Teams will subdivide. 
Certain teams will, over time  split apart into separate teams. For example, people working on optimizing our site for mobile would be part of our Compass team, but in the future this may split into a team called mobile. New learning activities start in the Lesson Design team, and over time they migrate to their own teams.

2) Logistical information resides within the team. 
All logistical information related to that team, such as meeting times for members, is stored within the team. All conversations about  a particular function should be stored within that team. This is important as conversations are a key source of documentation. 

3) Hotspots will arise. 
A hotspot is an item or task will fall under the purview of two or more teams. This will likely happen because this particular item has not been clearly defined as falling under the purview of a particular team. When these conflicts arise, a Cofactor moderator should update the definition of the team to include that new responsibility. It may be the case that the teams should meet and discuss responsibilities. There is also the possibility that the two teams should work together on this issue. Hotspot moderators should constantly be reviewing the teams to ensure that hotspots are identified and resolved.
