# Guide - How We Build Together

*This guide describes how we work together to build Quill.*

# Post Each Piece of Work on GitHub Issues

Every project you are working on should have a corresponding issue on GitHub. For example, if you are designing a new webpage, create a 'new issue' where you state, "I'm working on designing the homepage." Include any other details that are necessary, such as a link to the folder where you are storing your work. 


# Store Files in Google Drive

[Each project has a Google Drive folder.](https://drive.google.com/a/quill.org/#folders/0BxnurkJj9VglWERCaXI2S2xGWms) Email Peter at [Peter At Quill dot Org](peter@quill.org) to receive permission to modify the folder. Once you have permission, press "add to drive" to add the folder to your Google Drive. You can also sync all of the files with your computer via the [Google Drive desktop application.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive) Download the application, and then download the folder to the drive folder. 

All files should live within a google drive folder. Please store files there, and then share the link via GitHub issues or email. Please keep files organized by adding a file type word to the front of the name. See our "naming files" guide. 




# Ask Questions or Share Ideas on the Mailing List 

Every project has a mailing list. Please share your thoughts or ask questions on the mailing list. You can find each team's mailing list on the team's documentation page. Click here to access all of the teams. 


# Write Together over Google Docs

Whenever we have a meeting, we try to capture the conversation on Google Docs. This enables us to share our thoughts with the rest of the community. Please create a google doc and then move it into the appropriate folder.
