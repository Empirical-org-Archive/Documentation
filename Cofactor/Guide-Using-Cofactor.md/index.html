      <h1>Guide: Using Cofactor</h1>

<p><em>Cofactor bundles together some of the best collaboration tools on the internet. Many of these tools are built ontop of GitHub, and you'll need a GitHub account to take advantage of these tools.</em></p>

<h2>User Note: Outstanding Bugs</h2>

<p><strong>Cofactor relies upon a number of services. You will need to sign into each service, using GitHub or Google, to access each of these features.</strong> Cofactor is still in its prototype phase, and there a number of bugs. For example, when signing into a new service, you may need to open the service in a new window, as you will not be able to sign in through Cofactor.</p>

<p>Some of our services, upon signing in, may re-direct to you another page. The solution is simply to re-enter the url <a href="http://empirical.org/cofactor">http://empirical.org/cofactor</a>. </p>

<p>Once you are signed into every service, it should be easy to use Cofactor. If you run into issues, please add them to the Cofactor issue tracker page.  </p>

<h2>Issues Tracker</h2>

<p>All of our projects and tasks are arranged into issues. <strong>Anyone may propose or complete an issue.</strong> Issues are categorized by completion level, time commitment, project type, etc. This section explains how we categorize issues, so that you can jump into issues you're interested in.</p>

<p><strong>Development Stage</strong>: Please share your thoughts an issue at any stage!</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty Level</strong>: Projects are arranged by difficulty level. New contributors are encouraged to pick up starter projects. </p>

<p><strong>Completion Status</strong>: These categories indicate how far along an issue is. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uUK87w4.png" alt="Project Time Status"></p>

<p><strong>Project Teams</strong>: Our contributors are organized into teams, and each team is assigned projects. At the moment multiple sub-teams operate under the same Cofactor team. The "Team" designation indicates which team the project belongs to. </p>

<p>This is a sample of the various teams. A full description of each team can be found in the "Scope" document. </p>

<h2>Chat</h2>

<p>We use Gitter as our chatroom. All questions and discussion should first be posted to Gitter. If no one is around to discuss the idea, please post it is either to the issues tracker (if it is a project or task) or the mailing list (if it is a question or request). </p>

<p>Sign in with your GitHub account, and you can then chat with the rest of the team. Gitter messages do not disappear when you sign out, so feel free to leave messages that will be answered later. Gitter is tightly integrated with GitHub issues, so you can, for example, reference GitHub issues. </p>

<h2>Mailing List</h2>

<p>Every Cofactor team has its own mailing list. You can subscribe to the mailing list by clicking on the "New Topic" button. Sign in to Google, and then you can set how often you'd like to receive email requests. </p>

<p>The mailing list should be used to discuss new ideas, meeting times, and help requests. Once a specific task is under development, the discussion should be handled through the GitHub issue. </p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Certain Cofactor teams, such as the Empirical Core team, have a Questions mailing list. This mailing list is reserved for asking questions about getting started with the team.  Generally speaking, these are questions about to install or edit the code. If a team does not have a "Questions" function, a contributor should ask questions through the "Mailing List" function.  </p>

<h2>Text Editor</h2>

<p>Our text editor, called Contentify, allows multiple people to edit a single document, similar to Google Docs. The main difference is that Contentify uses markdown to style text. Writers more comfortable using Google Docs can create Google Docs and share the file in the appropriate folder. </p>

<p>To edit a file, a Contributor needs to be included in the "Documentation Access" team on GitHub. The contributor then has permission to create or edit any markdown file in the Documentation folder. A contributor can then create a document. Everyone who has the document open at the same time can collaboratively edit it. </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The Documentation function displays all of the markdown files. This system is currently slightly buggy, and it will be replaced with a Static Site Generator, such as Jekyll. </p>

<h2>Calendar</h2>

<p>This is a public calendar that anyone can edit. You can click on the calendar and add times that you would like to meet. The goal of this calendar is to have contributors vote on when they would like to meet. The project lead then takes this information to set up a meeting time. </p>

<p>To indicate when you'd like to meet, enter your name into the left hand name box. You can then mark which times you would like to meet. On the right side you can see all of the current votes. </p>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>We use Google Drive as our file storage system. Everything in the folder "Empirical Shared Files" is public information. You can access all of our files through the Google Drive folder application by signing in with Google. </p>

<p>You can also sync all of the files with your computer via the Google Drive desktop application. Download the application, and then download the entire Empirical Shared Files folder to your Google Drive. You can also sync a single folder by downloading that folder to your Google Drive folder. </p>
