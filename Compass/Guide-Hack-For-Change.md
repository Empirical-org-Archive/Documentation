# Thank you for hacking Quill

**Empirical** is a nonprofit, open source community that builds interactive education. 

We are currently building **Quill**, a web application that provides interactive writing activities for students. There are currently 10,000 students using our site. Read about our mission [here](http://www.quill.org/mission). 

**Cofactor** is **Empirical's** collaboration platform. Cofactor bundles together some of the best collaboration tools on the internet. Many of these tools are built ontop of GitHub, and you'll need a GitHub account to take advantage of these tools.

## Hack for Change Roadmap
*This list contains all of the current teams and projects we'd like to accomplish.* 

### Compass Team
*Compass is our interface for assigning lessons and viewing results.*

[View the Milestone.](https://github.com/empirical-org/Compass/issues?milestone=12&page=1&state=open)
1. **Compass Interface Upgrades.** There is a series of fixes that need to be made to Compass and Quill. This is a good team for less experienced developers. [The Milestone.](https://github.com/empirical-org/Compass/issues?milestone=12&page=1&state=open)
2. **GitHub as a CMS.** We host all of our lessons as text files in GitHub. Users can create and edit lessons via pull requests. The content is written to the database via headers. [The issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/Compass/issues/230)
3. **Review API Design.**


### Design and Homepage Team
*The Design and Homepage team builds tools and pages to connect to the commmunity.*

1. **Interactive Footer.** The goal of the interactive footer is to engage users by enabling users to post ideas and share via social media. [The issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/Design-Homepage/issues/6)


### Cofactor Team
*Cofactor is our engine for collaboratively building open source education.*

[View the Cofactor Team.](http://www.empirical.org/cofactor/teams/cofactor)

[View the milestone.](https://github.com/empirical-org/Cofactor/issues?milestone=1&state=open)

1. **Hack Huboard.** Huboard creates a kanban interface for GitHub issues. We need to change how the URLs are outputted to create direct links to a milestone or label. [The Issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/22)
2. **Add Back Buttons to Contentify.** Contentify is a collaborative text editor for markdown files. We have tweaked the interface, and we now need to add back buttons. [The Issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/19)
3. **Sync Contentify and GitHub repo.** Contentify does not stay synced with the markdown files in a GitHub repo. [The Issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/23)
3. **Setup a Static Site Generator for Documentation.** We need to set up a Static Site Generator to render the markdown files in the Documentation repo. [The Issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/24)
4. **Improve the Cofactor Menu.** The cofactor menu should be reduced to one line, and we need to set up a back button. [The Issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/17) 
5. **Install Lobsters as the Knowledge Base.** Lobsters is an open source Hacker News/Reddit clone built in Rails. We will set it up to aggegrate knowledge from accross the web. [The Issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/18)
6. **Contributors CMS.** Enable users to log in through GitHub, and create a profile page for each user. From this profile page the user can join teams and create a bio. [The Issue.](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/25)
