Hi, 

Thank you for helping out with Quill in the past. 

We recently launched a new site called Cofactor. Cofactor is an interface that bundles together all of the services we need to collaborate online. We've organized the various facets of Quill into teams, and you can see all of the current teams here:

Within each team we've bundled together a series of collaboration tools. For example, we've bundled together Gitter, a chat client built on top of GitHub, Contentify, a collaboartive text editor for markdown files, and Huboard, a Kanban interface for GitHub issues. We've also set up a mailing list, Google drive folder, and team calendar. 

I'm now hoping that you might have some time to work together on Quill. I'm reaching out to about thirty people who have contributed to Quill in the past, and I'd like to see if we could put together a couple of teams. Quill has been doing extremely well. For the past three months Quinn and I have been re-building the site in an API model, and you can read about it here: . We recently announced a major grant (Check out the news post here: ), and with that announcement we doubled our user base to 1,0000 teachers. We currently have 1,500 students using Quill every day, and we are now running into a few scaling issues we could use your help with.  

There are three projects on tap:

1) Docker Setup
We're currently on Heroku, and we'd like to move all of our applications to Linode via Docker containers. We'd like to put together a small team to focus on 

2) Integration Tests
We've run into some scaling issues now that we're growing, and we need a rigirous testing environment. We'd like to set up a 

3) Contributors System
At the moment Cofactor is simply an iframe for a variety of services. Over time we'd like to tightly integrate a variety of services into Cofactor. To get the ball rolling on this process, I'd like to set up a basic sign in with usernames, passwords, profile pictures, and basic biographic information. Over time this profile page will grow, as we features such as tracking developer contributions, connecting the account to GitHub, and managing mailing list settings. 

Do you think you'd be interested in helping out with either of these projects? It'd be great if we could jump into a text or video chat sometime and catch up. 

Best,
Peter
