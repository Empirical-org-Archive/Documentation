Building
--------

A good place to start is by setting up and running Quill on your
local machine or by using a [Vagrant virtual machine](VAGRANT.md).

**If you are having any trouble installing, [please post your questions here](http://empirical-discourse.herokuapp.com/t/quill-installation-guide).**

*Note:* Unless stated otherwise, all commands assume that your current working
directory is the Quill application root.

0.  __Setup ruby 1.9.3. You can use RVM or rbenv to achieve this, rbenv is recommended (https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). Here are the steps for installing os OS X:__

    Install homebrew (if you haven't already): http://brew.sh/

    Install rbenv:

    ~~~ sh
    brew update
    brew install rbenv ruby-build
    ~~~

    Install ruby:

    ~~~ sh
    rbenv install 1.9.3-p484
    ~~~

    Set it to your default ruby:

    ~~~ sh
    rbenv local 1.9.3-p484
    ~~~

1.  __Install dependencies.__

        bundle install

    *Note*: This may require you to install missing system packages using your
    system package handler (`brew`, `apt`, `yum`, etc.).

2.  __Set up your database configuration by creating and editing the file
    `config/database.yml` with appropriate connection information. Example
    information is provided below.__

        development:
            host: localhost
            adapter: postgresql
            encoding: unicode
            database: <database_name>
            pool: 5
            username: my_name
            password: my_pass

3.  __Build the database structure.__

    ~~~ sh
    sudo service postgres start   # may change depending on your OS

    rake db:create
    rake db:schema:load
    ~~~

4.  __Seed data into the database.__

        rake db:seed

    If you are granted access to a Heroku environment, you can also capture a
    database directly from that. Instructions below are for example only.

        heroku pg:capture --app <app>
        curl -o ~/latest.dump $(heroku pgbackups:url --app <app>)
        pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U <your_db_user> -d <database_name> ~/latest.dump

    *Note*: `<app>` is the name of the Quill deployment on Heroku you want to
    retrieve data from.

5.  __Ensure the following parameters are in your environment:__

        JRUBY_OPTS=--1.9
        APP_SECRET=your-secret-key
        HOMEPAGE_CHAPTER_ID=1

    Setting these up varies on your platform. You can `export` them in your bash config (not recommended) or use a config  file provided by either RVM (.ruby-env) or rbenv (.rbenv-vars). Please refer to their respective documentations if you need more information.

6.  __Start the app, make sure it works.__

    ~~~ sh
    rails server
    curl localhost:3000
    ~~~
