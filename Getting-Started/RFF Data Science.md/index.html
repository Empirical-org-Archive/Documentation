      <h1>Quill Request for Fellows: Data Science</h1>

<p><a href="www.quill.org">Quill.org</a> is a platform for interactive writing activities. Our goal is to collaborate with a data scientist who can help us analyze how students develop their writing skills. Quill presents students with ten minute activities that teach writing, grammar, and vocabulary skills. Quill was launched eight months ago, and we currently have 10,000 K-12 students using our activities. </p>

<p>Quill is being built by the nonprofit organization <a href="www.empirical.org">Empirical</a>. Empirical is funded through the Literacy Courseware Challenge, a series of grants provided by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. All of the activities are free to use, and Empirical provide enterprise level features as a premium service. Empirical is an open source organization and over fifty educators and developers have contributed code and lessons.</p>

<h3>We are looking for data scientists to help us tackle three challenges:</h3>

<h2>Challenge #1: Best Practices in Data Collection</h2>

<p>We are currently setting up our data collection systems, and it’d be great if we could review our system with a data scientist. In particular we are interested in three questions: 
* Is there any obvious data we should be collecting that we are not?
* What are the best data collection and analysis practices in order to prevent bias and error?
* How can we best connect <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/">this demograhic data</a> to our accounts? 
* How can we ensure that we properly anonymizing data sets so that we're protecting student privacy while making our data sets available to researchers?</p>

<h2>Challenge #2: Analyzing the Common Core Language Standards</h2>

<p>The United States’ education system is going through a major overhaul, where 45 states have recently adopted a shared curriculum called the Common Core State Standards. In the 2014-2015 school year students will now be tested on these standards, and the test results will dictate how much funding schools receive. </p>

<p>The Empirical team has built <a href="www.quill.org/lessons">150 lessons</a> from the Common Core language section and have found that the standards do not reflect the actual cognitive development of students. For example, the Common Core dictates that students should learn the difference between “who” and “whom” in the fourth grade, while we have found that students often learn this concept in the tenth grade. </p>

<p>We’d like to collaborate with a data science team to analyze how students are building their writing skills. The team would focus on a data-driven assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the Common Core language standards. We could then use these findings to make recommendations for how the Common Core could be improved. We strongly believe in the Common Core, but we also recognize that it needs to be improved. This is an opportunity to impact a set of standards used by millions of students. </p>

<h2>Challenge #3: Typing Speeds and Method of Input</h2>

<p>There is currently a strong debate occurring in K12 circles concerning the value of tablets vs. laptops. Schools are investing significant sums in these devices (<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/06/local/la-me-lausd-ipads-20131007">see LA’s investment of $1 billion into iPads</a>), and there are significant differences between a touch screen or a keyboard. </p>

<p>Quill is built on the principle of learning by writing, and we’d like to analyze how students are progressing through our platform with a physical keyboard or a tablet keyboard menu. Our hunch is that physical keyboards will significantly facilitate the writing process. This analysis could have a significant impact on the billions of dollars currently being spent on educational hardware as schools decide between tablets or laptops. </p>
