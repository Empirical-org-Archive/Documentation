      <h1>API Docs Questions</h1>

<h3>Are there ids as well in the /activities JSON responses?</h3>

<p>Yes, there is the ID in the JSON. The UID is the activity ID. </p>

<h3>Will Stories With Friends be handed an activity id via iFrame?</h3>

<p>Yes, via the UID. </p>

<h3>For PUT calls, can it be one or more keys, or must it be the entire JSON object.</h3>

<p>No, you can choose to only include the properties you want to update.</p>

<h3>In an Activity_Session, what is the “data” field?</h3>

<p>Data is a json object.</p>

<h3>For the access token mentioned throughout the docs. Does each student get a different access token?</h3>

<p>The access token is through the OAuth, and that is unique to each user. These OAuth tokens expire. </p>

<h3>Related, where do the uid and sid query string parameters play in?</h3>

<p>UID is activity id. When a user enters an application, an activity session has already been created. An activity session is created when the activity is assigned to the student. </p>

<p>?anonymous=true means that a user can go through without an activity session. If your application requires a session to run properly, you can create a temporary session using the API.</p>

<p>Data from the activity that is going to be saved (e.g. a story the students produce) will be saved back to the activity session. </p>

<h3>In Stories with Friends, how do you identify a user?</h3>

<p>SID is shared, and the UID is the identification number. </p>

<p>Two students will have their own activity session (UID). </p>

<h3>How to get the words list for the Activity?</h3>

<p>The activity_session does not contain any data about the activity. Instead it produces the results. </p>

<h3>What is an Activity?</h3>

<p>If there were five sets of words, each set of words would have its own activity. </p>

<p>Applications provide a form url to create activities for that particular application. </p>

<p>An application creator could set it up to accept any form of data. </p>

<h3>How do you integrate an app?</h3>

<p>You need to create a javascript event when an event is created, and an activity when the form is filled. </p>

<h3>Resizing the window?</h3>

<p>It should do so automatically. </p>

<h3>How does the application send data back to Empirical Core for creating an Activity?</h3>

<p>Take data and move into the json object, and then post data using API.</p>
