#Compass Out of Date Terms

*Quill has evolved signficantly since its inception. Consquently, there are many out of date terms.*

**This document outlines all of the dated terms. When you see a questionable term, post it here. 
We should refactor Compass to bring these terms up to update.**


#### (The current term) -> (The proper term)

## On Heroku

#### Quill Questions Module -> Quill Grammar
The Quill Grammar app is an app that provides our grammar activities. 

#### Quill API -> Compass API -> Empirical Core API

#### Empirical-Grammar -> Compass -> Empirical Core

#### Empirical-Grammar-Staging -> Compass-Staging -> Empirical-Core-Staging

## On GitHub

#### Quill-Lessons Repo -> Quill Grammar

## In the Code Base

#### Story -> Passage Proofreading
The Quill Grammar app has two components to it: a passage proofreading excercise and sentence writing excercise. These two excercises are using out of date terms. 

#### Practice Questions -> Sentence Writing

##Distinction - Quill vs. Empirical Core

This is perhaps the most confusing distinction, so it gets special treatment here. Empirical Core is our learning management system. With Compass teachers assign activities and view results. 

Quill is a branded version of Empirical Core focused on English writing activities. Over time we will introduce new branded sites focusing on different verticals, such as science and history. All of these various sites will be powered by Compass. As such, everything should be refered to as Compass, rather than as Quill.
